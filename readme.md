## Introduction - A dash dashboard presents the global disasterous status
Our project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard that analyzes global disaster data, sourced from the EM-DAT database, to visualize the impacts of climate-related disasters. By tracking key metrics such as total deaths, affected populations, and economic losses, the dashboard provides valuable insights into disaster trends. These insights support the United Nations' SDG Goal 13.1, which aims to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards. Through this tool, policymakers and disaster management agencies can make informed decisions, helping to reduce the risks associated with climate change and enhance global preparedness for future disasters.

### Key Features

- **Python programming**: Building the dashboard with Python for easy future development, cross-platform accessibility, and efficient data processing and updates.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an interactive, easy-to-use platform for policymakers, researchers, and disaster management teams.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**:  Eye-catching visuals and interactive plots, combined with a wide range of filters, allow users to explore disaster impacts, identify high-risk areas, and assess trends, supporting effective disaster preparedness and risk reduction.
- **An SDG 13 approach**: By providing real-time insights into climate-related disasters, enabling decision-makers to strengthen resilience, improve disaster preparedness, and reduce the risks associated with climate change impacts.
- **Climate-Related Focus**: By highlighting climate-related disasters, the dashboard underscores the growing impact of climate change on global vulnerabilities, reinforcing the urgency for adaptation and mitigation efforts.
